        ng-app attribute tells Angular where to instantiate the application
        - Pass in the module name
        - Everything inside ng-app is available for Angular to bind to
        - Alternatively drop ng-app and use angular.bootstrap(); to instantiate

<body ng-app="ngClyde">

    <div class="body-inner-container" ng-controller="IndexController">
        <!----menu----->
        <!----
            The ng-include directive includes the partial view menu.html located in the views folder. This app just uses this once but depending on the size of
            your app it is advisable to create such partial views and include it in your page so that you don't repeat the code your write.
        ---->
        <div ng-include='"views/menu.html"'></div>

        <!----content---->
        <!----
            The ng-view directive is used for routing different partials templates into this layout template (index.html). NOTE: in a given page you can use ng-view only once.
            The use of ng-view is not as direct as ng-include. It involves including the routing specific Angular script and configuring routes in the config() method on the module (we have done that in app.js).
        -->
        <div ng-view></div>

        <!--footer-->
        <!----
            webapp-footer is a custom element and is expressive i.e it tells the reader what it does (I am sure you can give it a name which is even more expressive!). Custom elements like this can be created by writing our own directive.
            We write our own directive using the .directive() method on the app's module and we have written it in app.js. NOTE: the module.directive method takes the normalized name of the directive (in this case: webappFooter)
            unlike the html element name which is case-insensitive and is dash-delimited
        ---->
        <webapp-footer></webapp-footer>

            Angular.js:
            - code.angularjs.org / any content delivery network like cloudflare, for example
            - Include Angular.js core at the top of all Angular dependencies
            - Angular-1.2.1.js - Main Angular used in this example
            - This example and presentation applies to 1.x versions of Angular JS
